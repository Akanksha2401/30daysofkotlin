//Enums are a bit like singletonsâ€”there can be only one, and only one of each value in the enumeration.
// For example, there can only be one Color.RED, one Color.GREEN, and one Color.BLUE.
// In this example, the RGB values are assigned to the rgb property to represent the color components.
// You can also get the ordinal value of an enum using the ordinal property, and its name using the name property.
